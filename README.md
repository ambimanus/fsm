This is a framework for simulating finite state machines (FSM), written in Java. This is part of my masters thesis project, the topic was "modelling and evaluation of desynchronization strategies for controllable cooling devices".

This code was used to prepare the development of a hardware controller for fridge devices. The goal was to transfer the desynchronization strategies from the masters thesis to real devices by equipping standard fridges with a smart controller.

Beware, this is from 2008 :)
